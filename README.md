# UGH!

A game for Android that is heavily inspired by an old game called UGH!, which was released for MS-DOS.


## Features:
- Gameplay is being drawn on 2D Canvas

- Tilt controls using the Accelerometer sensor
- "Intelligent" crate and enemy spawning
- Settings screen that uses SharedPreferences for persistence
- Level select screen using a GridView layout, Leaderboards using a ListView layout
- Leaderboards using the SQLite database system for tracking players' top times on levels
- Simple level importing - CSV format generated with the use of 'Tiled'
- Looping music

## More features to come later...
- Better level import format (JSON with enemy spawn rates, custom crate routes, level name, etc.)
